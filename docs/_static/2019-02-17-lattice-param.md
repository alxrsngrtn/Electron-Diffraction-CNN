Q: What's the experiment we are trying to run? 

Focus on Cubic. Focus on lattice parameters. 
  - distance from one atom to the next in x, y, and z space. 
  - just a scalar
  - in Cubic, they are all equal. 
    - x, y, z: 3.5 Aâ€¢
  - Can we expand to a 3 layer regression

Have the data to learn all the parameters for all three systems?

Want to run POC to learn one (just cubic), then eventually learn the general case.
